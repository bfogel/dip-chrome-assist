# dip-chrome-assist
A Chrome extension for improving the vftf Diplomacy experience

Planned improvements:

1) Improve timer visualization: it should modify the existing "X hours, Y minutes" rather than display separately
2) Voice alert should only fire when countdown crosses 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 30 seconds
3) The countdown should flash noticeably when under a minute
4) Support for other languages, both text and voice.  Prioritize French.
5) An icon in the title bar that brings up an info panel with VWDC branding
